# Installation

## Stable release

To install Django Activity Tracker, run this command in your
terminal:

```console
$ pip install django-activity-tracker
```

This is the preferred method to install Django Activity Tracker, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for Django Activity Tracker can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

```console
$ git clone git://github.com/William-Fernandes252/django-activity-tracker
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

```console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/William-Fernandes252/django-activity-tracker/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```console
$ pip install .
```
